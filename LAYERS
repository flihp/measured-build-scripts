# This file contains a description of all git repos used in this build.
# This should be bitbake and a bunch of OE meta layers.
# The format is pretty simple:
#  name repo_url branch revision
# where:
#  'name' is just an identifier for the repo
#  'repo_url' is the url where the git repo lives (the upstream)
#  'branch' is a branch or tag to checkout
#  'revision' is the desired HEAD. Requires that branch is set.
# If branch is omitted it is assumed to be 'master'.
# If revision is omitted it is assumed to be 'HEAD'.
